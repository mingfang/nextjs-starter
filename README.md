# NextJS Starter

Originally created using
```shell
npx create-next-app nextjs-starter --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server-express"
```

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

```shell
npm run dev
```
Starts the development server.

```shell
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production.

```shell
npm start
```
Runs the built app in production mode.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```shell
cd nextjs-starter
npm run dev
```
